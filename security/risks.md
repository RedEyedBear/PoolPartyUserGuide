# Risks

Your use of the PoolParty protocol involves various risks, including, but not limited to, losses while digital assets are being supplied to the PoolParty protocol. Before using the PoolParty protocol, you should review the relevant documentation to make sure you understand how the PoolParty protocol works.

The PoolParty protocol is a decentralized and open-source piece of software operating on the blockchain. No individual or institution has control over it. The protocol is controlled by the Shade protocol governance. There is a website that provides access to the protocol, however, this website simply provides an interface and does not control the protocol in any way.&#x20;

**REMINDER: LICENSES ARE NOT OFFICIAL AND NEED TO BE COMPLETED. THIS IS A DRAFT OF POOLPARTY LICENSES.**

AS DESCRIBED IN THE POOLPARTY PROTOCOL LICENSES, THE POOLPARTY PROTOCOL IS PROVIDED ”AS IS”, AT YOUR OWN RISK, AND WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND. No developer or entity involved in creating the PoolParty protocol will be liable for any claims or damages whatsoever associated with your use, inability to use, or your interaction with other users of, the PoolParty protocol, including any direct, indirect, incidental, special, exemplary, punitive or consequential damages, or loss of profits, cryptocurrencies, tokens, or anything else of value.

This section will help you understand the types of risks you are taking what has been done to mitigate them and how to mitigate them further.&#x20;

### Wallet Loss Risk <a href="#e5cb" id="e5cb"></a>

This risk doesn’t have anything to do with PoolParty but we wanted to mention it. Using PoolParty requires you to use a wallet(i.e. Keplr Wallet) that supports Cosmos chain apps. If you permanently lose access to this wallet, you will not be able to recover your funds. Different wallets have different recovery mechanisms. It’s important for you to know what those are and be able to recover your wallet.

### Smart Contract Exploit Risk <a href="#a908" id="a908"></a>

The second type of risk is specific to PoolParty. The risk is that there could be some sort of bug or exploit in the smart contracts that run the PoolParty Protocol. This is a risk with any product on Blockchain. Depending on what the bug or exploit is, a nefarious person may be able to take some or all of the funds stored in the PoolParty Protocol. Here’s what we’re doing to mitigate this risk.

1. Professional, third-party smart contract auditing. PoolParty has hired companies to professionally review and audit the smart contract code for any bugs or exploits. These auditors have produced reports with their findings.
2. Bug Bounty program. PoolParty will offer payment of up to $1000+ for reports of any bugs in the smart contracts. If someone was to discover a bug, this is a way for them to responsibly disclose it to us and be paid rather than exploit it.
3. All the smart contract code is open source, meaning it is publicly readable by anyone. At first, this may sound strange but it actually makes the protocol more secure as anyone can review it for bugs and submit a bug bounty.
4. Before we even give our code to auditors we also do extensive internal testing.

### Protocol Dependency Risk <a href="#a908" id="a908"></a>

The PoolParty Protocol uses several other Cosmos chains. Therefore the first type of risk is the risk that these other integrated chains can fail.
