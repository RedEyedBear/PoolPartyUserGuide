# Booster sNFT

The idea behind booster sNFT is straightforward. If the user didn't win any amount during the last round, he'd receive some boost points. These boost points will give the user more chances in the next round by enabling the user to generate more random sequences, or the user can buy one from stashh.io to give themselves a better winning chance.
