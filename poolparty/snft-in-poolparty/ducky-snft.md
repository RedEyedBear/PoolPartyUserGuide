# Ducky sNFT

### What is Ducky sNFT?

Ducky sNFT is like an ID card for PoolParty. Higher XP(Experience Points) user has more exclusive they became. By [exclusivity](https://haseeb-saeed.gitbook.io/poolparty-user-guide/welcome/other-upsides-of-staking-with-poolparty), we mean free/discounted mints for our coming sNFT projects and much more.

### Where to get Ducky sNFT?

Users have to stake 30 days to mint one of these, or they can buy one from stashh.io. Everyone will mint the same sNFT(Base character).&#x20;

### What are XP(Experience Points)?

Every user will get a specific XP based on the % of liquidity they provided during the round. Each pool of the protocol will receive a certain amount of XP. XP supply will be finite, so very few users will have the rarest traits and gadgets.

Initial sNFT would be primary and need XP(Experience Points) to upgrade/customize the NFT avatar. Higher the XP points are more new traits, and gadgets start to get unlocked.

### XP Distribution Schedule

Under the initial XP model, XP would be distributed according to a “thirdening” schedule. Similar to Bitcoin’s halvening, where token issuance is decreased by half every four years, in PoolParty, the XP distribution will be cut by ⅓ every two months.

This XP will be distributed among the different Pools of the protocol. The entire distribution structure is yet to be decided by the Team and advisors.
