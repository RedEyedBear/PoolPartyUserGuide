### Growth Flywheel&#x20;

PoolParty aims to increase the number of total winners and increase the number of Large prizes. Large prizes attract more deposits which creates bigger prizes attracting more deposits. Hence, large prizes attract more users and cause more staking rewards, which generate Large prizes for the users.

### Reserve Capture & Perpetual Growth&#x20;

The "Reserves" are the unclaimed prizes after 45 days of ending round. Tokens directed to the reserve make the prizes larger without diluting the odds of winning. Prizes, in turn, contribute to a larger reserve. This creates a [perpetual growth cycle](https://medium.com/pooltogether/perpetual-growth-db101a47791) and increases the expected value of a deposit into PoolTogether. A large reserve accelerates the growth flywheel.&#x20;
