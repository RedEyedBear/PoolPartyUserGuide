# ðŸ§  Ideology and Roadmap

### Ideology

PoolParty's mission is to provide a safe space for the users to interact with Blockchain with so little downside and too much upside **gamifying** the staking process with sNFTs and arcade games. We believe that games x Defi is the future of Web3.0. We aim to make sure that the Net value captured by the users should be greater than the value lost in staking rewards. Loyal users would be awarded massively. See more details [here](other-upsides-of-staking-with-poolparty.md).

With revenue capture mechanism. PoolParty's reserves will always grow; hence the total rewards always increase.

In the future, We aim to expand vertically and horizontally by adding more higher APR chains like JUNO and creating more value for existing users. We aim to become THE POOLPARTY of IBC ðŸ‘€.

### Roadmap

1\) Release of PoolParty with SCRT Pool.

2\) Addition of SHD Pool and HYDRO/OXY POOLS

3\) Additions of Archive games to PoolParty

4\) sNFT project: User will top Xp wins free mints

5\) Moving to other Cosmos chains like JUNO and EVMOS.

6\) Release of a utility token. Allocation of the token will be directly proportional to the XP your DUCKY sNFT has.&#x20;

7\) More to follow ðŸ¤«
