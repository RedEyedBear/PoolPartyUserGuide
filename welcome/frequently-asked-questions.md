# Frequently Asked Questions

## General

### Where does the prize money come from?

Prizes are generated on the staking rewards earned on deposited funds.&#x20;

### Do I have to enter for each prize?&#x20;

No! By depositing, you are automatically eligible for all future prizes until you withdraw! &#x20;

### Is there any penalty for withdrawing?

No! You can add to or withdraw your deposit whenever you desire! However, your chances of winning are based on your **average** deposit size over the prize period. But remember that every chain has its period, e.g., an unstaking period like 21 days for Secret Network.

For example, say you have a $100 deposit for an entire seven-day period. That would mean your average balance for the prize period is $100. Someone else might deposit $200 halfway through the prize period. Their average balance for the daily prize period would be $100; even though they deposited more than you, their chance to win would be the same.&#x20;

### How are winners chosen? How is it fair?

The PoolParty protocol is decentralized and open source. That means anyone can view and audit the code to verify it is fair and secure once it is made public, which will be pretty soon. Professional third parties are auditing the PoolParty code.

### Can I lose my coins? What are the risks?&#x20;

Assuming the protocol operates as intended, there is no risk of losing your coins.

However, **there are still many risks inherent in using a blockchain-based protocol. These risks could result in losing some or all of your money.** Please read the "[Risks](../security/risks.md)" page for more details on the specific risks you should know.&#x20;

## Prizes & Winning üèÜ

### What are my odds of winning?

Your chances of winning a prize are dependent on how much you have deposited. The more money you deposit, the higher your chances of winning. &#x20;

Your exact chances to win dynamically change in real-time based on how many others are depositing and withdrawing.&#x20;



### The total number of prizes being rewarded?

The number of total prizes can be changed as they find desirable by the community. There will be six tiers, with each level having a percentage of rewards allotted to that tier. The table below represents the Tier, number of winners, and amount dedicated to that Tier.&#x20;

| Tier | Number of winners | Percentage of Rewards |
| :--: | :---------------: | :-------------------: |
|   0  |         1         |           20          |
|   1  |         3         |           10          |
|   2  |         9         |           14          |
|   3  |         27        |           12          |
|   4  |         81        |           19          |
|   5  |        243        |           25          |

Using this method, we can have **364** winners. Let's say the total reward is 10,000 SCRTS. Then the 1 winner will win 2000 SCRTS, 3 will win 333.3 SCRTS each,  9 will win 155 SCRTS each, 27 will win 44.4 SCRTS each, and 81 will win 23.5 SCRTS each, and 234 will win 10.2 SCRT each.&#x20;

NOTE: SINCE THE WINNERS ARE LIMITED BY NUMBER, THE FIRST MOVER'S ADVANTAGE WILL CERTAINLY BENEFIT THE USER.

### How many prizes can you win?

There's no prize cap yet, which means anyone can win as many prizes as possible. But the code has a build-in cap coded in the contract that can prevent WHALES from sweeping all the prizes. The community can activate this feature.

### What is the maximum period before I can claim prizes?

Prizes should be claimed within 45 days of them being awarded. Unclaimed rewards will be diverted back to the pool **reserves** to increase the total yield for the tips.
